# STM32_UART_Communication

The main goal of this project is to implement a simple UART communication between the microcontroller and a personal computer. 

Using UART communication temperature of MCU, current date, UID, microcontroller name, and state of user button is broadcast. The program is written in C using the HAL library.  

Using user UI, which is implemented using python package tkinter, you can see all those values and also update the microcontroller name and sync the microcontroller's local time with the computer's local time.

Used microcontroller - STM32F207ZGT6
